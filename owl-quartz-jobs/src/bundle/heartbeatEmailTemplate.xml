        <subject>Check Quartz Jobs: Heartbeat Alert</subject>
        <message>
            The following Quartz jobs did not register a heartbeat within their time threshold:
            
            $jobs
            
            How to respond:
            
            1. Verify that there is no legitimate reason why the time threshold was exceeded (job was disabled, server was down, etc.)
            2. Resolve any stalled jobs
            3. Adjust monitored job list and time thresholds in sakai.properties as needed
